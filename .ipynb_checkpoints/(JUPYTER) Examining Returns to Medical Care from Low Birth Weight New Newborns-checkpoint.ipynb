    "Health care economists question whether the benefits of added medical care outweigh the costs. [Almond et al. (2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2903901/) propose a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) to compare health outcomes of newborns born around the threshold of 1500 grams. Those born under 1500 grams are considered very low birth weight and are consequently receive supplemental medical attention. Those born above the threshold are generally considered healthy. Notably, 1500 grams is a conventional measure not necessarily rooted in biology. \n",

    "This project provides an overview of RDD, evaluates its assumptions, re-produces findings from Almond et al., and presents thoughts on increased medical expenditures.  "
